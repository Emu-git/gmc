# zBassMusic
zBassMusic is a modern music system for Gothic I and Gothic II NotR based on [BASS Audio Library](https://www.un4seen.com/) made by [Silver Ore Team](https://github.com/Silver-Ore-Team). It replaces the old DirectMusic system to let the modders create music for Gothic as regular audio files instead of DirectMusic format.
