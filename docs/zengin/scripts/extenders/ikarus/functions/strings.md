The provided code appears to be a partial implementation of string manipulation functions in the Ikarus scripting language. Let's go through each function and document its purpose:

1. `STR_GetCharAt`:
   - Purpose: Returns the ASCII value of a character at a specific position in a string.
   - Parameters: `string str` (the input string), `int pos` (the position of the character).
   - Returns: The ASCII value of the character at the specified position.

2. `STR_Len`:
   - Purpose: Returns the length of a string.
   - Parameter: `string str` (the input string).
   - Returns: The length of the string.

3. `STR_toChar` and `STRINT_toChar`:
   - Purpose: Converts a string to a character pointer.
   - Parameter: `string str` (the input string).
   - Returns: The character pointer representation of the string.

4. `STR_FromChar`:
   - Purpose: Converts a character to a string.
   - Parameter: `int char` (the input character).
   - Returns: The string representation of the character.

5. `STR_SubStr` and `STR_Prefix`:
   - Purpose: Extracts a substring from a given string.
   - Parameters: `string str` (the input string), `int start` (the starting position of the substring), `int count` (the length of the substring).
   - Returns: The extracted substring.

6. `STR_Compare`:
   - Purpose: Compares two strings and returns the result.
   - Parameters: `string str1` (the first string), `string str2` (the second string).
   - Returns: An integer indicating the comparison result: `STR_GREATER` (1) if `str1` is greater, `STR_EQUAL` (0) if they are equal, or `STR_SMALLER` (-1) if `str2` is greater.

7. `STR_ToInt`:
   - Purpose: Converts a string to an integer.
   - Parameter: `string str` (the input string).
   - Returns: The integer value of the string.

8. `STR_IndexOf`:
   - Purpose: Finds the index of a substring within a string.
   - Parameters: `string str` (the input string), `string tok` (the substring to find).
   - Returns: The index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or -1 if not found.

9. `STRINT_SplitReset`, `STRINT_Split`, `STRINT_SplitGet`, `STR_Split`, and `STR_SplitCount`:
   - Purpose: These functions are related to splitting a string into substrings based on a separator.
   - `STRINT_SplitReset`: Resets the internal state for splitting.
   - `STRINT_Split`: Splits the string into substrings based on the separator.
   - `STRINT_SplitGet`: Retrieves a specific substring based on its offset.
   - `STR_Split`: Splits the string and retrieves a specific substring based on its offset.
   - `STR_SplitCount`: Returns the number of substrings obtained by splitting the string.

10. `STR_Upper` and `STR_Lower`:
   - Purpose: Converts a string to uppercase or lowercase.
   - Parameter: `string str` (the input string).
   - Returns: The converted string in uppercase or lowercase, respectively.

It's important to note that this code snippet may not be complete, as it seems to be a part of a larger codebase. The missing parts could include function declarations, required headers, and additional utility functions.
